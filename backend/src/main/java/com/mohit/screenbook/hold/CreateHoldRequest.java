/**
 * Boxed Long rather than long, deliberately. A primitive cannot be null, so an
 * absent field would arrive as 0 and @NotNull would never fire. Boxing is what
 * lets validation tell "missing" apart from "zero".
 *
 * A List, not a Set. A Set would silently collapse [5, 5, 7] to [5, 7], and a
 * repeated seat is a client bug worth reporting rather than hiding. The
 * duplicate check lives in HoldService, because no standard constraint
 * annotation expresses it and a custom validator is a lot of ceremony for one
 * rule.
 *
 * The cap is enforced here, on the server. A cap that only exists in the UI is
 * not a cap.
 *  * The @Size ceiling is the absolute maximum anyone can ask for, and exists to
 *  * reject absurd payloads before they reach a service. The real limit is lower
 *  * for guests and is enforced in HoldService, because it depends on who is
 *  * asking and a bean validation annotation cannot see that.
